display_title: Global Neutrino Network <br> Machine Learning <br> Working Group
order: 1
---

This WG aims to facilitate the advancement of, and collaboration around, machine learning (ML) methods at neutrino telescope experiments, by providing a forum for openly sharing and discussing results and ideas within ML as it relates to the unique priorities and challenges of neutrino physics.


## How to join

Everyone with an interest in the intersection of neutrino/astroparticle phyics and machine learning are more than welcome to join the WG by signing up to our Mattermost forum and join our meetings (see below):

* [Mattermost forum](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/{{ site.mattermost_id }})
* [Indico category](https://indico.cern.ch/category/{{ site.indico_category_id }}/)
* [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }})


## Meetings

Working group meetings are intended to occur on a monthly basis. See below for past and upcoming scheduled meetings.
Meetings are announced ahead of time by the coordinator for each participating experiment.
Meetings are open to all members of the participating experiments.

If you wish to present your own work, please watch for calls for proposals that may be sent out before each  meeting, or contact the coordinators at any time via email (see [About](about/#coordinators)).

**Please be aware** that, since the working group meetings are attended by members of multiple collaborations, so you should ensure that results that you intend to show are public, experiment-independent, and/or approved by your collaborators, if relevant.
