Since late 2021, we have been working to set up the Global Neutrino Network Machine Learning Working Group.
We are now ready to schedule the inaugural meeting, which will take place on **Friday, 8 April 2022 at 15:00 (CET)** via Zoom. Meeting coordinate can be found [here](/#meetings).

This first meeting is intended to provide a "state of the nation" regarding the use of machine learning at IceCube and KM3NeT, to give attendees with an up-to-date understanding of the current ML landscape at the two experiments.
Subsequent meetings will then focus in greater detail on individual ML efforts, e.g., physics analyses using ML, ML model performance studies, novel architectures and techniques, etc.

If you would like to present your work at an upcoming meeting, please reach out to your collaboration's [coordinator](/about#coordinators).
